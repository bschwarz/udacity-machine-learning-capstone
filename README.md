# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Proposal
See the proposal.pdf in this repo for the proposal for this project.

## Datasets
The datasets are provided by Udacity. Instead of replicating those datasets in this repo, you can download those datasets from the links provided by Udacity for the [dog images](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip) and the [human images](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz). A break down of the datasets is as follows:
1) Dog images - there are a total of 8351 dog images. There are datasets for train, test and validate, with each having 133 different dog breeds. The train dataset has roughly 20 images per dog breed, and seems to be balanced.
2) Human images - there are a total of 13233 human images. There are 5749 different people represented in those pictures. Some people have multiple images, and others just have one. So, this dataset is imbalanced.
